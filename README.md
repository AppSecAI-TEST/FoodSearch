#FoodSearch

This repository contains a project created for LifeSum's CodeTest for Android Developer position.

It makes use of the most popular and hyped pattern in Android these days. Dagger + MVP + RxJava. 

Main Components
===============
[StorIO](https://github.com/pushtorefresh/storio) for my ORM Implementation.

[Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) for the network requests.

[Dagger](http://google.github.io/dagger/) for dependency injections.

[MaterialDrawer](https://github.com/mikepenz/MaterialDrawer) for the drawer menu.

[LoganSquare](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/LoganSquare) for JSON parsing.

[Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) for logging.

[Butterknife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife) for Views injection.

[Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) for Image loading.

[EventBus](https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus) for Events communication.

Bonus
=====
From the bonus part of the CodeTest, I implemented a FoodDetails Screen and Caching of requests. Also user can save foods
and search them offline.
Due to limited time, I did not implement animations, multi-add or UnitTesting.
